This is a language detector I built in C++ and wrapped as a python module.

It uses basic trigram style identification, and is built to be fast and reliable.
Some accuracy tradeoffs were made for speed over other similar algorithms, but accuracy remains very high for even short sample texts.
This is currently used in a large commercial database application in production, and has proven to be stable, reliable, and fast.

Makes heavy use of custom hash tables using Murmur hash for fast lookups.
